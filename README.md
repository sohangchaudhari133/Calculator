# JavaScript Calculator (using eval())
A simple calculator app built using JavaScript and the eval() function to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project demonstrates how to use eval() to evaluate mathematical expressions input by the user, providing a quick and easy way to perform calculations.

# Features:

Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Dynamic calculation using eval() to evaluate expressions directly
Simple and user-friendly interface
Designed for quick, on-the-go calculations
# Note:
While eval() is convenient for evaluating expressions, it's important to note that it can have security implications, especially if used with untrusted input. This project uses eval() for educational purposes. If you're building more complex applications, it's recommended to explore safer alternatives for evaluating user input.

# Getting Started:
